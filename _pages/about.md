<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

👋Hi there, I am Zhiwei Shang (尚致违), currently a research assistant at [Intelligent Transportation (INTR) Thrust](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/intelligent-transportation/) in the [System Hub](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou campus)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Meixin Zhu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=5Ysgg7AAAAAJ).

Before this, I received Master of Electronic and Information Engineering in Computer Technology from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Yunduan Cui](https://cuiyunduan.vercel.app/). I received Bachelor of Engineering in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research interests lie in the study of Artificial Intelligence algorithms and their engineering applications. I believe that the development of Artificial Intelligence can help us build a better, safer and more equal society！You’re more than welcome to write me an email to connect (or make friends)! Let’s explore the exciting world together! 🌌
