<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

👋Hi there, I am Zhiwei Shang (尚致违), currently a research assistant at [Intelligent Transportation (INTR) Thrust](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/intelligent-transportation/) in the [System Hub](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/systems-hub/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou campus)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Meixin Zhu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=5Ysgg7AAAAAJ).

Before this, I received Master of Electronic and Information Engineering in Computer Technology from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Yunduan Cui](https://cuiyunduan.vercel.app/). I received Bachelor of Engineering in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research interests lie in the engineering applications of artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning, and in particular in the development of robust and efficient control algorithms for autonomous vehicles and robots operating in complex environments.
